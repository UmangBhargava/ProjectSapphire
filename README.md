# Banking System Project 

This project is an online Transaction system which is useful for making transactions, hence saving most of the time and hassle of going directly to the bank for depositing or withdrawing money. 

The program asks the user to login or exit in the first page. If the option selected is to login, it asks the user to enter their user ID and Password.

This project includes two types of accounts, namely Admin and User account. The menu options for the users will be different based on their nature, i.e. user or admin.
